# Software Engineering At Google

## Thesis

### What is Software Engineering

Software engineering is more than coding: It encompasses the entire lifecycle of software creation, including design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance over it's useful lifespan.

Building effective teams is crucial: Google emphasizes collaboration, communication, and fostering a culture of learning and sharing knowledge.

Key values for success: Concepts like humility, respect, trust, and psychological safety are highlighted as essential for effective teamwork.

Focus on the user: Google's culture prioritizes building software that meets user needs and delivers a positive user experience.

## Culture

### How to work well on Teams

People are inherently insecure about what they write and hence do not want to share early and instead wait for it to be completed. Instead build psychological safety to promote early sharing of ideas and progress so people can get feedback. Someone on your team may have already solved for some of the problems you might be facing.

No one person is a genius. It is always a team effort.

Practice humility, respect and trust others to do their jobs. Lose the ego. Learn to give and take criticism. Fail fast and iterate. Learn to be patient. Be open to influence.

#### Attributes to look for:

1. Thrives in ambiguity - Can deal with conflicting messages or directions, build consensus, and make progress against a problem, even when the environment is constantly shifting.

1. Values feedback - Has humility to both receive and give feedback gracefully and understands how valuable feedback is for personal (and team) development. 

1. Challenges status quo - Is able to set ambitious goals and pursue them even when there might be resistance or inertia from others.

1. Puts the user first - Has empathy and respect for users of Googleâ€™s products and pursues actions that are in their best interests.

1. Cares about the team - Has empathy and respect for coworkers and actively works to help them without being asked, improving team cohesion.

1. Does the right thing - Has a strong sense of ethics about everything they do; willing to make difficult or inconvenient decisions to protect the integrity of the team and product.

### Knowledge Sharing

Promote a culture of mentorship. People should not be afraid to ask questions.

Grow your knowledge by asking questions and understand the context.

Scale your questions through group chats or mailing lists.

Scale your knowledge by having office hours, tech talks and classes. Documentation is important and should be easily accessible and discoverable. It is good to have documentation reside closer to the code.

Scale your organization's knowledge.
